# Programming Language Classifier

Identifies the programming language of a full source code or just a snippet.
It returns the guessed file extension, so if your source code has 20% HTML
with 80% CSS and JS it will return HTML.

I wrote it for a syntax highlighter for myself, it's not perfect but I
couldn't find a better solution for the (for me) required Web Languages:
html, css, php, and js

## Sample

```php
<?php
require 'LangDetect.class.php';

$code = 'alert("Hi");';

// you can set the languages like: new LangDetect($code, 'php, js');
$ld = new LangDetect($code);
print_r($ld->getProbabilities(true));
```

## Currently supported languages

I currently support CSS, HTML, JS (especially tested with ECMAscript 5.5),
and PHP (tested with PHP <7).

btw. you could contribute :)

## We did a little contest

That I needed this function wasn't the only reason for writing a script :D  
We did a little contest and developed this for one to two days.

You can find more tricky tests of this contest here: https://su.at/f1
